# encrypt-decrypt
encrypt & decrypt files using python script.

two simple scripts, encrypting and decrypting files.

suitable for python 3.

both scripts need to be at the same folder for them to work properly.

when encrypting, if the file you wish to encrypt is located at the same folder as the scripts, you can choose to write just the file's name (with its extension) instead of the full path.

when decrypting and choosing a file name, make sure to write the name with the original file extension.
